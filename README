Libchloride is a C++ wrapper for libsodium. Libsodium is a portable
implementation of Daniel Bernstein's cryptographic NaCl (pronounced
'salt') library.

Libchloride was written in standard C++11 to be portable, even tough
only the *NIX build system (make) is supported for now. 

INSTALLATION

To install a release version of the library, change into the project's
root directory (containing the Makefile) and enter:
make
Acquire root privileges and enter:
make install

To install a debug version of the library, repeat the above steps with
the DEBUG variable declared in the environment, for instance:
make DEBUG=1
make install DEBUG=1

USAGE

Include the header file chloride.h in your source code and link your
executables with -lchloride or -lchloride-debug (and -lsodium).

There is an example.cpp source file include in the project package
which demonstrates the library's core features. You can compile this
example with:
make example DEBUG=1
(You don't have to install the library to compile the example.)

NOTES

Libchloride was originally inspired by Ruben De Visscher's sodiumpp and
provides a form of Z85 encoding, which libsodium doesn't. Please note
that libchloride's form of Z85 encoding is incompatible with sodiumpp's
because the latter uses an inefficient padding method.
